# Business Fundamentals Project Proposal

**1. What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**

The goal of this project is to build a model to accurately predict heart disease diagnosis for FitBit company,
which has been helping many people to stay motivated and improve health by keeping track of it.

Disease Prediction plays a pivotal role in healthcare informatics. It is crucial to diagnose the disease at an early stage


**2. Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**

I believe that  FitBit company can make use of this model to help many people to track any kind of heart disease at very early stage.

**3. What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**

Heart Disease Dataset:

The data set has patient's medical records details.

**4. What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**

ECG Reading during Exercise (slope)
ECG Reading during Rest (restecg)
Chest Pain Type (value 1-4)
Exercise induced angina (exang--boolean)
Hypertension (htn--boolean)
Age
Cholesterol (chol)
Resting Heart Rate (thalrest)
Peak Heart Rate during exercise (thalach)
Resting BP (trestbp--Sys. + Dias.)
Peak BP (tpeakbp--Sys. + Dias.)
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect


**5. If modeling, what will you predict as your target?**

To predict if a person is under a risk of having heart disease

**6. Tools:**
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn,Excel sheet, matplotlib/seaborn.

**7. MVP Goal:**
My initial goal is to find a basic prediction model accuracy.
