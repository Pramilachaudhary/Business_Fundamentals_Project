## Analyzing Feature for Detecting Heart Disease at an Early Stage for Fitbit Users
Pramila Chaudhary

# Abstract:
The goal of this project is to deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis/relationships between 
medical factors related to heart disease and patterns to FitBit. Disease Prediction plays a pivotal role in healthcare informatics. 
It is crucial to diagnose the disease at an early stage to minimize the heart related issue. I have used the patient's medical records 
for preliminary analysis and found that features like Age, types of chest pain, max heart rate and resting Blood pressure has the heighest 
positive coorelation with the target and as well as with each other.

# Design:

  **Business Problem**

  How to detect heart disease at early stage for Fitbit users.

  **Solution paths:**
  
  Predict heart disease at early stage based on linear reggression prediction model based upon the following methods:
    1. Identify the positively correlated features with the target and eaxh other
    2. EDA for each of the feature which will be uselful for the model
    3. Find the linear relationship between the features.

  **Impact hypothesis**

   By better understanding how features are involved in predicting the disease at early stage to avoid any kind of complication for Fitbit users. 
   Early dectection can reduce the risk of disease as well as if treated on time can also reduces the possibility of death.

  **Measures of success:**
   
   Successfully detecting the potential risk of heart disease at a very early stage For Fitbit users.

  **Risks and assumptions:**

  Risk: Factors like a person's family health history, smoking intake, weight, eating habbits ect are not included in the data set, 
        which sometimes can be the reason of cause of disease. 
  Assumption: Factors mentioned above are not effecting the prediction.

# Data Set

  1. Death certificate report and their cause of death from CDC.
  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2019.htm?search=Heart_disease,
  
  2. Data set has patient's medical records details.

## Algorithms

  1. Data Cleaning & EDA: Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis was carried out in Google Sheets and Tableau.
  2. Feature selection based on Relationship between two features.
  
## Visualization:

# Future work

In future work, I plan to develop a Linear Regression model which will succussfully predict the heart disease at early stage for Fitbit users.


# Tools
  1. Google Sheets for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
  2. Tableau for data visualization
